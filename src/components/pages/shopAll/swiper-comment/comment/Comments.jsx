                Absolutely beautiful. My niece was ecstatic with how beautiful her bouquet is. She has shared photos with me & mum &                       we are over the moon. You are amazing ðŸ¤© You have a wonderful talent. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
                I will be telling all my friends & family about you ðŸ’–
